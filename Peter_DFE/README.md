# DFE Peter

## Summary

- This folder contains two DFE main folders: "DFE_tf" and "DFE_torch".

- The folder "models" contains all the model structures and "utils" contains all the utility functions for the both DFE tensorflow and PyTorch.

- The folder "checkpoints" contains all the trained models for both DFE tensorflow and PyTorch, if you don't have the folder, please use `mkdir checkpoints` to create it.
After that, you can download the trained weights from our NAS (DigitalUPDRS/QPD_Shared/Peter_DFE_Training_Weights).

## How to use?

If you want to reproduce the results in my thesis, please run the code in the folder "DFE_torch" or "DFE_tf" and follow the instructions in their README.md file.
All my work was using DFE_torch, but if you want to use the previous version of DFE, please use the "DFE_tf" folder.
